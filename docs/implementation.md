### Step 1: Set Up the Main Viewport with Isometric Grid

#### Goal
Create the main viewport displaying a 5000x5000 unit isometric grid at a 60-degree angle, with light gray grid lines, black-filled cells, and visible coordinate labels (0 to 5000 in increments of 250 when zoomed out).

#### Approach
- Use Three.js to render a WebGL canvas in a React component.
- Create a grid helper for the 5000x5000 unit grid with 20 divisions (250-unit increments).
- Apply an isometric camera angle (60 degrees from top-down).
- Add coordinate labels as 3D text objects along the grid edges.
- Style the grid lines in light gray and fill cells with black using a semi-transparent material.
- Use TailwindCSS for basic layout and dark mode styling.

#### Specific Instructions
1. Create a `Canvas` component in `src/components/Canvas.tsx` to house the Three.js scene.
2. Initialize a Three.js scene, camera, and renderer with WebGL.
3. Set the camera to an isometric view (60-degree angle) using `THREE.PerspectiveCamera` and position it to view the entire grid.
4. Add a `GridHelper` with 5000 units, 20 divisions, and light gray color (`#d3d3d3`).
5. Create a semi-transparent black plane (`THREE.Mesh` with `THREE.PlaneGeometry`) for each grid cell, sized 250x250 units, positioned at integer multiples.
6. Use `THREE.TextGeometry` to add coordinate labels (0 to 5000, step 250) along the X and Y edges, ensuring they face the camera and remain visible.
7. Apply TailwindCSS classes (`bg-gray-900 min-h-screen`) to the parent div for dark mode.
8. Ensure the canvas resizes with the window using `window.addEventListener('resize')`.
9. Log scene initialization details using `loglevel` (e.g., `log.info('Scene initialized')`).
10. Stop for feedback before proceeding.

```typescript
// src/components/Canvas.tsx
import * as THREE from 'three';
import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import log from 'loglevel';

export const Canvas = () => {
  const mountRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const scene = new THREE.Scene();
    const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 10000);
    camera.position.set(5000, 5000, 5000 * Math.tan(Math.PI / 6)); // 60-degree angle
    const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
    renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
    mountRef.current?.appendChild(renderer.domElement);

    const grid = new THREE.GridHelper(5000, 20, '#d3d3d3', '#d3d3d3');
    scene.add(grid);

    log.info('Scene initialized');
    // Add cell planes and labels here

    return () => {
      mountRef.current?.removeChild(renderer.domElement);
    };
  }, []);

  return <div className="bg-gray-900 min-h-screen" ref={mountRef} />;
};
```

**Stop Here**: Please review the isometric grid setup, including camera angle, grid lines, cell fill, and coordinate labels. Provide feedback before proceeding to the next step.

---

### Step 2: Implement View Toggle (Isometric to Birds-Eye)

#### Goal
Add a toggle button in the top-right corner to switch between isometric (60-degree) and birds-eye (90-degree top-down) views, re-rendering the canvas instantly without animations, ensuring coordinate labels and grid remain consistent.

#### Approach
- Add a toggle button using a Lucide icon (`Eye`) in the top-right corner.
- Use Zustand to store the current view state (`isometric` or `birds-eye`).
- Update the camera position and orientation based on the view state.
- Ensure coordinate labels adjust dynamically but maintain consistency (20 labels at 250-unit increments when zoomed out).
- Log view changes with `loglevel`.

#### Specific Instructions
1. Create a Zustand store in `src/store/viewStore.ts` with a `view` state (`'isometric' | 'birds-eye'`) and a `toggleView` action.
2. In `Canvas.tsx`, subscribe to the view store and update the camera position: isometric (`z = 5000 * tan(π/6)`) or birds-eye (`z = 5000`, looking straight down).
3. Add a `ViewToggle` component in `src/components/ViewToggle.tsx` with a Lucide `Eye` icon, styled with TailwindCSS (`fixed top-4 right-4 bg-gray-800 p-2 rounded`).
4. On toggle click, call `toggleView` and re-render the scene instantly (no animations).
5. Ensure coordinate labels remain visible and consistent in both views, using the same 0–5000 range with 250-unit increments.
6. Log view changes (e.g., `log.info('Switched to birds-eye view')`).
7. Stop for feedback.

```typescript
// src/store/viewStore.ts
import { create } from 'zustand';
type ViewState = { view: 'isometric' | 'birds-eye'; toggleView: () => void };
export const useViewStore = create<ViewState>((set) => ({
  view: 'isometric',
  toggleView: () => set((state) => ({ view: state.view === 'isometric' ? 'birds-eye' : 'isometric' })),
}));

// src/components/ViewToggle.tsx
import { Eye } from 'lucide-react';
import { useViewStore } from '../store/viewStore';
export const ViewToggle = () => {
  const { view, toggleView } = useViewStore();
  return (
    <button className="fixed top-4 right-4 bg-gray-800 p-2 rounded" onClick={toggleView}>
      <Eye className="text-white" />
    </button>
  );
};
```

**Stop Here**: Please verify the view toggle functionality, ensuring instant switching, correct camera angles, and consistent coordinate labels. Provide feedback before continuing.

---

### Step 3: Add Zoom and Pan Navigation Controls

#### Goal
Implement zoom (mouse wheel/pinch) and pan (click-drag/swipe) controls, ensuring mobile panning doesn’t select objects, with consistent behavior in both views and coordinate labels adjusting for zoom levels (down to 20x20 grid at max zoom).

#### Approach
- Use Three.js `OrbitControls` for desktop zoom/pan, customized for mobile gestures.
- Prevent object selection during mobile panning by tracking touch events explicitly.
- Adjust coordinate label increments based on zoom level (250 units zoomed out, 1 unit at max zoom for 20x20 grid).
- Maintain snap-to-grid visibility during navigation.

#### Specific Instructions
1. In `Canvas.tsx`, add `OrbitControls` from `three/examples/jsm/controls/OrbitControls`.
2. Configure controls: enable zoom (mouse wheel/pinch), pan (click-drag/swipe), disable rotation.
3. For mobile, use `touchstart` and `touchmove` events to differentiate panning (single finger) from selection (tap).
4. Update coordinate labels dynamically: at max zoom, show 1–20 labels for a 20x20 grid; otherwise, scale labels proportionally.
5. Log navigation actions (e.g., `log.info('Zoom level changed to ${zoomLevel}')`).
6. Stop for feedback.

```typescript
// src/components/Canvas.tsx
import { OrbitControls } from 'three/examples/jsm/controls/OrbitControls';
useEffect(() => {
  // Existing scene setup
  const controls = new OrbitControls(camera, renderer.domElement);
  controls.enableRotate = false;
  controls.enableZoom = true;
  controls.enablePan = true;

  const handleTouchStart = (e: TouchEvent) => {
    if (e.touches.length === 1) e.preventDefault(); // Prevent selection
  };
  mountRef.current?.addEventListener('touchstart', handleTouchStart);
}, []);
```

**Stop Here**: Please test zoom and pan controls on desktop and mobile, ensuring no accidental selections and correct label scaling. Provide feedback before proceeding.

### Step 4: Create Object Library Page

#### Goal
Build the object library page, accessible via a bottom-right factory icon, displaying a grid of object cards with name, XY dimensions, isometric preview, and Import/Duplicate/Delete buttons, including default “Mill” and “Wall” objects and a “+” card for creation.

#### Approach
- Create a new route `/library` using React Router.
- Add a factory icon button (Lucide `Factory`) in the bottom-right corner to navigate to the library.
- Render a grid of cards using TailwindCSS (`grid grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-4 gap-4`).
- Pre-populate with “Mill” (4x4x8) and “Wall” (2x1x1) objects in a Zustand store.
- Include a “+” card to open a creation modal (implemented later).

#### Specific Instructions
1. Install `react-router-dom` and set up routes in `src/App.tsx` for `/` (canvas) and `/library`.
2. Create `ObjectLibrary` component in `src/components/ObjectLibrary.tsx`.
3. Define an object store in `src/store/objectStore.ts` with `Object` type (`{ id: string; name: string; x: number; y: number; z: number; color: string }`) and initialize with default objects.
4. Render cards with name, dimensions, Three.js isometric preview (use `Canvas` with a small scene), and buttons (Import, Duplicate, Delete).
5. Add a `Factory` icon button in `Canvas.tsx` (`fixed bottom-4 right-4`) to navigate to `/library`.
6. Log library access (e.g., `log.info('Navigated to object library')`).
7. Stop for feedback.

```typescript
// src/store/objectStore.ts
import { create } from 'zustand';
type Object = { id: string; name: string; x: number; y: number; z: number; color: string };
type ObjectState = { objects: Object[]; addObject: (obj: Object) => void };
export const useObjectStore = create<ObjectState>((set) => ({
  objects: [
    { id: '1', name: 'Mill', x: 4, y: 4, z: 8, color: '#ff0000' },
    { id: '2', name: 'Wall', x: 2, y: 1, z: 1, color: '#00ff00' },
  ],
  addObject: (obj) => set((state) => ({ objects: [...state.objects, obj] })),
}));
```

**Stop Here**: Please review the object library page, including navigation, default objects, and card layout. Provide feedback before continuing.

After reviewing the original PRD against the proposed steps, I’ve identified a few details that were either insufficiently addressed or omitted. These include specific aspects of error handling, object duplication/deletion mechanics, floorplan edit/export specifics, and performance considerations. Below, I’ll integrate these into the existing steps as substeps (e.g., 8b, 8c) or a new step where appropriate, ensuring every PRD detail is covered. I’ll maintain the same structure (##Goal, ##Approach, ##Specific Instructions, <code sample>, Stop Here) for consistency and clarity, emphasizing specificity for Claude.

Review of Missing Details
Object Management - Duplicate/Delete Buttons (Step 4): The PRD specifies interactive buttons (Import, Duplicate, Delete) on object cards, but Step 4 only mentions them without implementation details. This needs explicit actions in the object library.
Object Manipulation - No Editing Post-Creation (Step 7): The PRD states objects cannot be edited after creation, only duplicated/deleted. Step 7 covers placement and manipulation but doesn’t enforce this explicitly.
Floorplan Management - Edit/Export Details (Step 8): Step 8 mentions edit/export icons but lacks specifics on renaming (edit) and JSON structure for export, as required by the PRD.
Data Management - Auto-Save and Conflict Rules (Step 9): Step 9 covers storage and JSON import/export but doesn’t explicitly implement auto-save on every change or detail the conflict resolution (skip objects, notify name clashes) fully.
Error Handling - Visual Feedback (Across Steps): The PRD requires visual feedback for failed operations (e.g., red glow for invalid placement, disabled buttons), which is partially covered but not consistently applied (e.g., import errors, storage limits).
Performance - Reasonable Performance Note (Missing): The PRD mentions maintaining reasonable performance on standard hardware, which wasn’t addressed as a step.
Additions to Existing Steps
Step 4b: Implement Object Library Duplicate and Delete Functionality
Goal
Add Duplicate and Delete button functionality to object cards in the library, ensuring users can copy or remove objects (including defaults “Mill” and “Wall”), with logging for debugging.

Approach
Extend the objectStore with duplicateObject and deleteObject actions.
Wire these actions to the Duplicate and Delete buttons on each card.
Log each operation for traceability.
Specific Instructions
In src/store/objectStore.ts, add duplicateObject and deleteObject to the store:
duplicateObject: Create a new object with the same properties but a new id.
deleteObject: Remove the object by id, filtering the objects array.
In ObjectLibrary.tsx, for each card, add Duplicate (Lucide Copy) and Delete (Lucide Trash) buttons below the Import button.
On Duplicate click, call duplicateObject with the object’s id; on Delete click, call deleteObject.
Ensure default objects (“Mill”, “Wall”) can be duplicated or deleted like user-created ones.
Log actions: log.info('Duplicated object ${name}') and log.info('Deleted object ${name}').
Stop for feedback.

      const obj = state.objects.find((o) => o.id === id);
      if (obj) {
        const newObj = { ...obj, id: crypto.randomUUID() };
        log.info(`Duplicated object ${obj.name}`);
        return { objects: [...state.objects, newObj] };
      }
      return state;
    }),
  deleteObject: (id: string) =>
    set((state) => {
      log.info(`Deleted object ${state.objects.find((o) => o.id === id)?.name}`);
      return { objects: state.objects.filter((o) => o.id !== id) };
    }),
}));
Stop Here: Please test the Duplicate and Delete buttons in the object library, ensuring they work for all objects and are logged correctly. Provide feedback before proceeding.

---

### Step 5: Implement Object Creation Modal

#### Goal
Add a modal for creating new objects from the “+” card, with fields for name, XYZ dimensions (positive integers, max 500x500x100), color picker, isometric preview, and cancel button, enforcing constraints and saving to the object store.

#### Approach
- Create a modal component triggered by the “+” card click.
- Use React forms for input fields, with validation for integer dimensions.
- Integrate `react-color` for color selection.
- Show a live Three.js preview of the object based on input values.
- Save valid objects to the Zustand object store.

#### Specific Instructions
1. Install `react-color` and create `ObjectCreationModal` in `src/components/ObjectCreationModal.tsx`.
2. Open the modal when clicking the “+” card in `ObjectLibrary.tsx`.
3. Include inputs for name, X/Y/Z (type `number`, min `1`, max `500` for X/Y, `100` for Z), and a `SketchPicker` from `react-color`.
4. Validate inputs: integers only, no negatives, within limits; show error messages in red.
5. Render a Three.js preview using a small canvas, updating dynamically with inputs.
6. On save, add to `objectStore` with a unique ID (e.g., `crypto.randomUUID()`).
7. Include a Lucide `X` icon (`fixed top-2 right-2`) to close the modal.
8. Log creation attempts (e.g., `log.error('Invalid dimensions')` if validation fails).
9. Stop for feedback.

```typescript
// src/components/ObjectCreationModal.tsx
import { SketchPicker } from 'react-color';
import { X } from 'lucide-react';
const ObjectCreationModal = ({ onClose }: { onClose: () => void }) => {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');
  const [dims, setDims] = useState({ x: 1, y: 1, z: 1 });
  return (
    <div className="fixed inset-0 bg-black bg-opacity-50 flex items-center justify-center">
      <div className="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded">
        <X className="fixed top-2 right-2 cursor-pointer" onClick={onClose} />
        <input type="text" value={name} onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)} className="mb-2" />
        <SketchPicker />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

**Stop Here**: Please test the object creation modal, including input validation, preview, and saving. Provide feedback before proceeding.

---

### Step 6: Build 3D Object Model Design

#### Goal
Implement the 3D model design for objects with a 0.5-unit thick base (matching XY dimensions) and a top block (0.2 units smaller in XY, remaining Z height), with filleted vertical edges, using Three.js.

#### Approach
- Create a reusable `ObjectModel` component to render objects based on store data.
- Use `THREE.BoxGeometry` for base and top block, adjusting sizes per PRD.
- Apply `THREE.MeshStandardMaterial` with user-specified color.
- Use `THREE.ConvexHull` or similar for filleted edges along Z-axis.
- Test with default objects (Mill, Wall).

#### Specific Instructions
1. Create `ObjectModel` in `src/components/ObjectModel.tsx`, accepting `x`, `y`, `z`, `color` props.
2. Generate base geometry: `THREE.BoxGeometry(x, y, 0.5)`.
3. Generate top block: `THREE.BoxGeometry(x - 0.2, y - 0.2, z - 0.5)`, positioned at `z = 0.5`.
4. Apply filleting to vertical edges using a simple chamfer (approximate with `THREE.BoxGeometry` edge softening if `ConvexHull` is complex).
5. Use `THREE.MeshStandardMaterial` with `color` prop.
6. Add to the scene in `Canvas.tsx` for testing with default objects.
7. Log model creation (e.g., `log.info('Created model for ${name}')`).
8. Stop for feedback.

```typescript
// src/components/ObjectModel.tsx
import * as THREE from 'three';
const ObjectModel = ({ x, y, z, color }: { x: number; y: number; z: number; color: string }) => {
  const base = new THREE.Mesh(
    new THREE.BoxGeometry(x, y, 0.5),
    new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({ color })
  );
  const top = new THREE.Mesh(
    new THREE.BoxGeometry(x - 0.2, y - 0.2, z - 0.5),
    new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({ color })
  );
  top.position.z = 0.5;
  return <primitive object={[base, top]} />;
};
```

**Stop Here**: Please verify the 3D model design, including base/top block sizing and filleted edges. Provide feedback before continuing.

---

### Step 7: Implement Object Placement and Manipulation

#### Goal
Enable object placement from the library to the grid with green/red glow feedback, check/X buttons, rotation icon, snap-to-grid, and collision detection, supporting drag-to-move and 90-degree rotations post-placement, identical in both views.

#### Approach
- Add a placement mode in the canvas when importing from the library.
- Use raycasting for mouse/tap position to snap to grid integers.
- Check collisions against placed objects in a Zustand store.
- Show green/red glow (`THREE.MeshBasicMaterial` outline) and check/X/rotate icons (Lucide `Check`, `X`, `RotateCw`).
- Support drag-to-move and rotation post-placement with same feedback.

#### Specific Instructions
1. Create a `placementStore` in `src/store/placementStore.ts` with `placingObject` (null or `Object`) and `placedObjects` array (`{ id: string; objectId: string; x: number; y: number; rotation: number }`).
2. In `ObjectLibrary.tsx`, set `placingObject` on Import click and navigate to `/`.
3. In `Canvas.tsx`, render `placingObject` at mouse/tap position, snapped to grid (`Math.floor`).
4. Check collisions: iterate `placedObjects` for overlapping XY bounds.
5. Apply green (`#00ff00`) or red (`#ff0000`) outline material based on collision.
6. Show `Check` (enabled if no collision), `X`, and `RotateCw` icons above object using 2D overlay divs.
7. On check, add to `placedObjects`; on X, clear `placingObject`.
8. For placed objects, enable click-to-select, drag-to-move, and rotation, reusing placement logic.
9. Ensure birds-eye view shows top face only (adjust `ObjectModel` render).
10. Log placement actions (e.g., `log.info('Placed object at ${x},${y}')`).
11. Stop for feedback.

```typescript
// src/store/placementStore.ts
type PlacementState = {
  placingObject: Object | null;
  placedObjects: { id: string; objectId: string; x: number; y: number; rotation: number }[];
  setPlacingObject: (obj: Object | null) => void;
};
export const usePlacementStore = create<PlacementState>((set) => ({
  placingObject: null,
  placedObjects: [],
  setPlacingObject: (obj) => set({ placingObject: obj }),
}));
```

**Stop Here**: Please test object placement and manipulation, including collision detection, snap-to-grid, and view consistency. Provide feedback before proceeding.

Step 7b: Enforce No Editing Post-Creation for Objects
Goal
Explicitly enforce that objects cannot be edited after creation, only moved, rotated, duplicated, or deleted, aligning with the PRD’s simplicity constraint.

Approach
Ensure ObjectModel and placement logic don’t allow post-creation edits.
Reinforce that manipulation is limited to position and rotation, with duplication/deletion as the only modification paths.
Log attempts to edit as errors for debugging.
Specific Instructions
In ObjectModel.tsx, make props (x, y, z, color) immutable by not exposing setters or edit interfaces.
In Canvas.tsx, when rendering placed objects, use original objectStore data without modification options.
If a user tries to edit (e.g., via dev tools or future UI), log an error: log.error('Object editing not allowed post-creation').
Confirm that dragging (position) and rotation (90-degree increments) work as the only manipulations in placementStore.
Stop for feedback.

  // Log edit attempts if triggered externally
  if (window.devEditAttempt) log.error('Object editing not allowed post-creation');
  return <primitive object={[base, top]} />;
};
Stop Here: Please verify that objects cannot be edited post-creation, only moved/rotated, with appropriate error logging. Provide feedback before continuing.


---

### Step 8: Build Left Panel for Floorplan Management

#### Goal
Create a collapsible left panel with a toggle button, “+” button for new floorplans, and a scrollable list of floorplans, supporting creation (new or import) and switching, with modals for naming and JSON upload.

#### Approach
- Create a `LeftPanel` component with slide-in/out animation using TailwindCSS transitions.
- Use a Zustand store for floorplans (`{ id: string; name: string; objects: PlacedObject[] }`).
- Add a modal for creating new floorplans or importing JSON.
- Render floorplan list with edit/export icons (Lucide `Edit`, `Download`).

#### Specific Instructions
1. Create `floorplanStore` in `src/store/floorplanStore.ts` with `floorplans` array and `activeFloorplanId`.
2. Create `LeftPanel` in `src/components/LeftPanel.tsx`, toggled by a Lucide `Menu` icon (`fixed top-4 left-4`).
3. Use TailwindCSS for animation (`transition-transform duration-300`).
4. Add a “+” button to open `FloorplanCreationModal` with name input, “Start new,” and “Upload” button with drag-drop area.
5. Render floorplan list (`overflow-y-auto`) with highlighted active floorplan and `Edit`/`Download` icons.
6. On modal confirm, add to `floorplanStore` and set as active; for uploads, validate JSON schema.
7. Log floorplan actions (e.g., `log.info('Created floorplan ${name}')`).
8. Stop for feedback.

```typescript
// src/components/LeftPanel.tsx
import { Menu, Edit, Download } from 'lucide-react';
const LeftPanel = () => {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);
  return (
    <>
      <button className="fixed top-4 left-4" onClick={() => setIsOpen(!isOpen)}>
        <Menu />
      </button>
      <div className={`fixed top-0 left-0 h-full bg-gray-800 transform ${isOpen ? 'translate-x-0' : '-translate-x-full'} transition-transform duration-300`}>
        <button className="p-4">+</button>
        <div className="overflow-y-auto">
          {/* Floorplan list */}
        </div>
      </div>
    </>
  );
};
```

**Stop Here**: Please review the left panel, including toggle animation, floorplan creation, and list rendering. Provide feedback before continuing.

Step 8b: Detail Floorplan Edit and Export Functionality
Goal
Implement specific edit (rename only) and export (JSON with object and layout data) actions for floorplans, ensuring the edit modal and JSON structure match PRD requirements.

Approach
Add a rename modal for the edit icon in the floorplan list.
Implement export to generate a JSON file with all objects and their placements.
Log edit/export actions for traceability.
Specific Instructions
In floorplanStore.ts, add renameFloorplan action to update a floorplan’s name by id.
In LeftPanel.tsx, on Edit click, open a RenameFloorplanModal with a text input and Lucide X to close.
On Download click, generate JSON: { name: string, objects: Object[], placements: PlacedObject[] } and trigger download (<a> with data: URI).
Log actions: log.info('Renamed floorplan to ${newName}') and log.info('Exported floorplan ${name}').
Stop for feedback.
typescript

Collapse

Copy
// src/store/floorplanStore.ts
export const useFloorplanStore = create((set) => ({
  // Existing code...
  renameFloorplan: (id: string, newName: string) =>
    set((state) => {
      log.info(`Renamed floorplan to ${newName}`);
      return {
        floorplans: state.floorplans.map((fp) =>
          fp.id === id ? { ...fp, name: newName } : fp
        ),
      };
    }),
}));
Stop Here: Please test floorplan renaming and JSON export, ensuring the modal works and JSON includes all required data. Provide feedback before proceeding.

---

### Step 9: Implement JSON Export/Import and Local Storage

#### Goal
Add JSON export/import for floorplans, persisting data in local storage with auto-save, validating imports, and handling conflicts (skip conflicting objects, notify name clashes).

#### Approach
- Use `localStorage` to store floorplans and objects, updating on changes.
- Implement export as JSON with object and placement data.
- Validate imports against a schema, adding objects to library and creating a new floorplan.
- Show name conflicts in import modal; skip conflicting objects during placement.

#### Specific Instructions
1. In `floorplanStore` and `objectStore`, add `saveToLocalStorage` to persist state on changes.
2. In `LeftPanel.tsx`, add export button to download JSON (`JSON.stringify(floorplan)`).
3. In `FloorplanCreationModal`, handle JSON upload: parse, validate schema (`{ name: string; objects: Object[]; placements: PlacedObject[] }`).
4. Add valid objects to `objectStore`; create new floorplan with placements, skipping conflicts.
5. Show name conflicts in modal (e.g., “Object ‘Mill’ exists”).
6. Log storage and import actions (e.g., `log.error('Storage limit reached')` if fails).
7. Stop for feedback.

```typescript
// src/store/floorplanStore.ts
export const useFloorplanStore = create((set) => ({
  floorplans: [],
  saveToLocalStorage: () => {
    try {
      localStorage.setItem('floorplans', JSON.stringify(get().floorplans));
    } catch (e) {
      log.error('Storage limit reached');
    }
  },
}));
```

**Stop Here**: Please test JSON export/import and local storage, including conflict handling and auto-save. Provide feedback before proceeding.

Step 9b: Enhance Data Management with Auto-Save and Conflict Details
Goal
Add auto-save on every change, refine conflict handling (notify name clashes in modal, skip conflicting objects silently), and log storage errors visually, per PRD requirements.

Approach
Use Zustand middleware to auto-save to localStorage on state changes.
Update import modal to display name conflicts explicitly.
Skip conflicting objects during placement without notification, logging the skips.
Add visual feedback for storage errors.
Specific Instructions
In floorplanStore.ts and objectStore.ts, wrap create with persist middleware from zustand/middleware, saving to localStorage on every change.
In FloorplanCreationModal, during JSON import, compare objects names with existing ones; show conflicts in a <ul> (e.g., “Conflict: Mill”).
When placing imported objects, skip any with overlapping positions in placedObjects silently, logging log.info('Skipped object ${name} due to collision').
On storage failure, show a red TailwindCSS alert (bg-red-500 text-white) with “Storage limit reached”.
Stop for feedback.

    }),
    { name: 'floorplans' }
  )

### Step 10: Optimize for Mobile and Finalize UI/UX

#### Goal
Ensure mobile responsiveness (min iPhone 10 size), reduce button sizes, support pinch-to-zoom and swipe-to-pan, apply dark mode Apple-like UI, add slide animations for modals/sidebars, and log errors comprehensively.

#### Approach
- Use TailwindCSS responsive classes (`sm:`, `md:`) for mobile sizing.
- Implement touch gestures in `Canvas.tsx` for pinch and swipe.
- Apply dark mode (`bg-gray-900 text-white`) and Apple-like styles (rounded corners, shadows).
- Add slide animations to modals/sidebars (`transition-transform`).
- Log all errors (placement, storage, import) with `loglevel`.

#### Specific Instructions
1. In `Canvas.tsx`, adjust button sizes for mobile (`sm:p-1` vs `p-2`).
2. Use `touchstart`/`touchmove` for pinch-to-zoom and swipe-to-pan, ensuring no selection during swipe.
3. Apply dark mode across components (`bg-gray-900 text-white border-gray-700`).
4. Add animations to modals (`transition-transform duration-300`) and sidebars.
5. Log errors for all operations (e.g., `log.error('Invalid placement at ${x},${y}')`).
6. Test on mobile browsers (min iPhone 10 resolution: 375x812).
7. Stop for feedback.

```typescript
// src/components/Canvas.tsx
const Canvas = () => {
  return (
    <div className="bg-gray-900 text-white min-h-screen">
      <ViewToggle className="sm:p-1 p-2" />
      {/* Canvas setup */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

**Stop Here**: Please verify mobile responsiveness, gestures, dark mode UI, animations, and error logging. Provide final feedback.

Step 10b: Add Visual Error Feedback Across Features
Goal
Ensure all significant operations provide visual feedback for failures (e.g., red glow, disabled buttons, import errors), as required by the PRD, beyond just logging.

Approach
Add red glow or disabled states for invalid actions (placement, creation, import).
Show error messages in modals or alerts for user-facing issues.
Apply consistently across existing components.
Specific Instructions
In Canvas.tsx, for invalid placement, disable Check button (disabled class: opacity-50 cursor-not-allowed) alongside red glow.
In ObjectCreationModal.tsx, show red text under inputs for invalid dimensions (e.g., “Must be 1–500”).
In FloorplanCreationModal, display import errors (e.g., “Invalid JSON format”) in red below the upload area.
Log all errors as before, but add visual cues: log.error paired with UI feedback.
Stop for feedback.
